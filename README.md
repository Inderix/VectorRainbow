Pride and rainbow-centric wallpapers in SVG and PNG format! :3
All SVGs are edited in Figma, as such some effects seen in final PNG renders of wallpapers may be missing in the SVG versions.

## Navigation
The repo is structured as nicely as I think possible to make it easy to find the specific colorscheme and style you're looking for

Folders are sorted as follow:
```
|-> Flag (🏳️‍🌈, 🏳️‍⚧️, etc.)
|   |-> Style (The design itself)
|   |   |-> Files (SVGs & PNGs at various sizes)
```
