Pride and rainbow-centric wallpapers in SVG and PNG format! :3
All SVGs are edited in Figma, as such some effects seen in final PNG renders of wallpapers may be missing in the SVG versions.

## Navigation
The repo is structured as nicely as I think possible to make it easy to find the specific colorscheme and style you're looking for

Folders are sorted as follow:
```
|-> Flag (🏳️‍🌈, 🏳️‍⚧️, etc.)
|   |-> Style (The design itself)
|   |   |-> Files (SVGs & PNGs at various sizes)
```
## Contributing
Making contributions is easy as pie, and doesn't need any programming experience, just some basic know-how with SVG editing. Keep the following in mind when making a new design:
- Consistency
  - Keep things consistent with the other wallpapers, using similar colors to other wallpapers, transparency levels, etc. See below for a style guide, including colors to use. 
- Inclusion
  - Make your SVGs keeping in mind that others may edit/revise them, and create different sizes of the design for various screen aspect ratios. If you see a specific SVG in your style/colors missing, feel free to contribute it!
- Fulfil the basic requirements
  - When submitting new designs, the PR should...
    - Have all submitted files in the right folder
    - Include at least one SVG and PNG render of each submission
    - A consise description of the submitted files
